## Background

The COVID-19 virus has already killed millions of people around the world.

When a COVID-19 patient arrives at the hospital, it is essential to assess if the patient should be sent home or if he/she should be admitted to the hospital because of the high risk of developing severe symptoms that will require admission to the Intensive Care Unit. This could save lives.

How can we determine if COVID-19-positive patients should be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit based on previous patient experiences and outcomes?

We will use data obtained during Triage and Laboratory tests made on COVID-19 patients to predict admission to the hospital should be required.

## Problem Definition

COVID-19 symptoms can quickly escalate from mild symptoms to severe. Most COVID-19-positive patients first had influenza-like symptoms. But many of those patients ended up in the ICU in a fight to survive.

The objective is to predict if a COVID-19 patient should be admitted to the hospital or treated at home. If a patient is likely to end up in the ICU, he/she should be admitted to the hospital and not allowed to go home.

## Objective

Classify patients into 2 classes: ICU and no-ICU. Provide insights.

## Dataset
